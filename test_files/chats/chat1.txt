[01/15/2023, 08:30:45] Alex: Hey everyone, I wanted to ask for some advice.
[01/15/2023, 08:31:20] Maria: Sure, what's up?
[01/15/2023, 08:32:15] Alex: My partner and I have been arguing a lot lately over small things.
[01/15/2023, 08:33:05] Maria: That happens sometimes. How long has this been going on?
[01/15/2023, 08:34:30] Alex: About a month. It seems like everything I do irritates them.
[01/15/2023, 08:35:15] Carlos: Have you tried talking to them about how you're feeling?
[01/15/2023, 08:36:45] Alex: I've tried, but it usually turns into another argument.
[01/15/2023, 08:37:30] Maria: Maybe you both need some space to cool off?
[01/15/2023, 08:38:10] Carlos: Or perhaps try writing your feelings down first, to organize your thoughts.
[01/15/2023, 08:39:25] Alex: That's not a bad idea. I might try that.
[01/15/2023, 08:40:05] Maria: Let us know how it goes!
